# next version of rip

## Things to remember to add

- README setup should use the https git url. Or, there should be a complicated
setup step to included adding an ssh key before cloning ...
- brew doesn't edit ~/.zshrc anymore, has a simplified shell setup
- rustup completions in /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_rustup

```
rustup completions zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_rustup
rustup completions zsh cargo > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_cargo
```

- wrong astro config is being used currently. Should be aegatlin/dotnvim.
- remove whatsapp and zoom from `mac comms` list
