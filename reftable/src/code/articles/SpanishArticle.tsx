    <h2>The Spanish Alphabet</h2>
    <p>
      As of 2010 the Spanish alphabet, or Abecedario includes 27 letters; 5
      vowels, and 21 consonants.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some letters have different colloquial names in some regions, each
      letter has a recommended official name as prescribed by the Real Academia
      Española.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spanish alphabet uses Latin script so letters other than ñ will be
      familiar to most English speakers, as well as speakers of other languages
      that use the Latin alphabet. However, in Spanish, the names of each of the
      letters and their pronunciations are different from English and other
      Latin-origin languages.
    </p>
    <h2>Diacritical marks</h2>
    <p>Diacritical marks are used in Spanish writing.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Accent marks are used on vowels (e.g. á, é, í, ó, ú) to indicate
        emphasis
      </li>
      <li>Tildes are used to augment pronunciation. For example, mañana</li>
      <li>Umlauts or diaeresis are occasionally added above the letter u</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Although it is common to see diacritical marks above many letters, within
      the Spanish alphabet only ñ is seen as an independent letter.
