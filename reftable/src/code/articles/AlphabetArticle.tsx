    <h2>About Alphabet Tables</h2>
    <p>
      Learning a new alphabet is difficult. Alphabets with different scripts
      like Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Japanese are particularly difficult given
      you have to learn different characters as well as new sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our alphabet charts make learning easier by giving you a clean interface,
      which helps you focus on what’s most important in your learning journey.
    </p>
    <h3>How to use our alphabet charts</h3>
    <h4>Hover</h4>
    <p>Hover over a row to highlight a specific letter.</p>
    <h4>Toggle columns</h4>
    <p>
      Use the ‘+’ toggle to hide/unhide columns so you can focus on particular
      letters, or even test your knowledge.
    </p>
    <h4>Send us feedback</h4>
    <p>
      Let us know what you want! Do you have suggestions for other features? Or
      wish there was additional language information on the site? We work hard
      to keep this tool as clean and as user friendly as possible, and we would
      love to hear your feedback. We’d love to hear from you, even just to say
      hi! You can reach us at team@aegleg.com
    </p>
    <h4>Download</h4>
    <p>
      Reftable is a Progressive Web App, meaning you can download the tool and
      use it on your phone, just like any other mobile app.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it’s better than a native mobile app because we don’t take up as much
      memory, we don’t track your information or location, and we don’t track
      your access to other apps. It just sits on your phone ready for you to use
      whenever you want!
