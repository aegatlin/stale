    <h2>About the Hebrew Alphabet</h2>
    <p>
      The Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters and is sometimes called the “alef-bet”
      because of its first two letters. Its written from right to left and does
      not have case, however five letters have different forms when used at the
      end of a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrew script is used for writing the Hebrew language as well as
      Yiddish, Judaeo-Spanish, Judeo-Arabic, and Judeo-Persian.
    </p>
    <h3>Consonants and Vowels</h3>
    <p>
      Hebrew letters consist only of consonants, however modern Hebrew may
      utilise points above or below letters (known in Hebrew as niqqud) to
      denote vowel sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to vowels being denoted by niqqud, scribes used the “consonantal
      vowels”(also known as matres lectionis) י ו ה א to indicate that the
      reader should use a corresponding vowel sound. This can be seen in
      biblical and rabbinic Hebrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Full spelling” refers to the practice of using both niqqud and the
      consonantal vowels to identify vowels.
    </p>
    <h2>Styles of Writing</h2>
    <p>
      The above alphabet chart for consonants shows the three most common Hebrew
      writing styles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The block print (Assyrian Script) is used most commonly in Hebrew writing.
      It’s also referred to as the Jewish script, square script or sometimes
      Assyrian script.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hebrew cursive is commonly used when writing Hebrew by hand. Unlike
      English cursive, however, the letters are not attached to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rashi is also used, but primarily for historical reasons. It is used in
      rabbinic commentaries. For example, in the Talmud, the commentary is
      written in Rashi, and can be used to distinguish commentary text from the
      original text.
